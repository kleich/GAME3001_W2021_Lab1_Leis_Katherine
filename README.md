# GAME3001-W2021-Lab 1

Lab 1 - GAME3001 Artificial Intelligence - Katherine Leis 

Worked with a starter project and modified code with a "code-along" in class. Further modifications have been made to:
- Make the spaceship & green line face the target (blue circle)
- ImGui button to reposition the target circle
-- Ship will rotate to face the moved target & continue seeking
